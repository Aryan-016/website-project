                        Established in the year 1964 along with the inception of the Institute, the Department of Civil Engineering is one of the earliest in the campus. The Department offers several degree programmes including a four-year B.Tech in Civil Engineering and a two-year M.Tech under various specializations, viz., Transportation, Structural, Environmental, Geotechnical Engineering, and L&T-sponsored Construction Technology and Management. Some of the best students in the country are inducted into these programmes through competitive examinations (JEE and GATE). They continue to excel in their career by following the highly curated academic curriculum and numerous technical and non-technical student clubs in the civil engineering department. Full-time PhD, funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, PhD (part-time), and MS (by research) are also offered here. 
                        The department has the largest faculty strength proportion in the Institute, who are dynamic and highly motivated towards teaching and research. They specialise in diverse research areas and handle various research projects funded by the Government of India agencies and consultancy projects. The journal publications are closer to 100/year. The department is Recognized as a Nodal Centre by the State Technical Agency for PMGSY works. The department obtained Centre of Excellence in Transportation Engineering (CETransE) from MHRD, Government of India (2.5 crores). The department has organized many national and internal conferences, notably the First International (Indo-US) Workshop on Forensic Engineering in December 2010.
