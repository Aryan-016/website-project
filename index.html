                        With great pleasure, I extend a warm and hearty welcome to everyone for the 14th Structural
                        Engineering Convention (SEC-2024) hosted at the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli
                        (NIT-T) on December 12 – 14, 2024.
                        This convention marks a significant milestone in the history of NIT-T, as we take immense pride
                        in
                        hosting this prestigious event for the first time. We are honoured to be at the forefront of
                        discussions, innovations, and breakthroughs in structural engineering. With experts,
                        professionals,
                        and visionaries from around the world gathered under one virtual roof, this conference promises
                        to
                        be an enriching and enlightening experience for all.
                        NIT-T, a premier Institute with the motto ‘Locally relevant and globally competent’, is
                        dedicated to
                        creating an environment that fosters curiosity, innovation, and the exchange of ideas. SEC-2024
                        reflects our commitment to providing a platform for the global community to come together and
                        address challenges and opportunities.
                        Over the course of the convention, you will have the opportunity to interact with leading
                        experts as
                        we have assembled an outstanding line-up of keynote speakers and panellists who are pioneers in
                        their respective fields. You can explore the latest advancements in materials, design
                        techniques,
                        and construction methods through our technical sessions and stalls put up by our sponsors and
                        collaborate in their R&D works. The conference provides a platform for networking, as you can
                        connect with peers, exchange ideas, and forge partnerships that can drive innovation and
                        progress.
                        We will recognise and honour outstanding contributions to the field with awards and accolades,
                        highlighting the dedication and achievements of individuals and organisations.
                        As the Director of the Institute and the Patron of this conference, I would like to extend my
                        heartfelt gratitude to our sponsors, partners, and the organising committee for their unwavering
                        support in making SEC-2024 possible. Together, we aim to elevate structural engineering
                        standards
                        and pave the way for a safer, more sustainable future.
                        As we celebrate the Diamond Jubilee year of NIT-T, I invite all participants to explore the
                        beautiful campus and the historical city of Tiruchirappalli, providing a delightful backdrop to
                        complement the intellectual exchange at SEC-2024. I encourage you to actively participate in the
                        sessions, ask questions, share your knowledge, and maximise this unique opportunity.
                        Once again, welcome to the 14th Structural Engineering Convention (SEC-2024) at NIT-T! Together,
                        let
                        us build a brighter, safer, and more resilient future through the power of structural
                        engineering.
                        Thank you for being part of this momentous occasion.
                        Warm regards,

                    The 14 Structural Engineering Convention (SEC-2024) will be held at the National Institute of
                    Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT-T) under the aegis of the Indian Association for Structural
                    Engineering (IASE). It is a biennial event pioneered by the CSIR-Structural Engineering Research
                    Centre (CSIR-SERC) Chennai and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras in 1997 and since then,
                    it has successfully completed thirteen conventions nationwide. SEC brings together academia,
                    industry and research laboratories and aims to provide an international platform for the
                    dissemination of the latest research findings in the field of Structural Engineering. Even though it
                    has been biennial since 2008, it was held consecutively in 2022 and 2023 to compensate for its
                    suspension in 2020 due to COVID-19. IASE has decided to keep up with the tradition of holding it in
                    the even years, and that brings us to SEC-2024.
                    The main objective of SEC-2024 is to promote and enable a safe and sustainable construction sector
                    in India. The conference will feature traditional paper presentations by research scholars around
                    the world, keynote speeches by invited speakers and several discussions addressing the
                    state-of-the-art technologies and future challenges in Structural Engineering. The latest
                    developments in the analysis and design of novel/traditional materials and systems will be
                    presented, for a wide range of structural applications. We, the NITT fraternity, are delighted to
                    organize SEC-2024 and cordially invite you to participate and contribute to SEC-2024.
